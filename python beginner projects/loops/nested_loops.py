# This code prints pairs of numbers where x ranges from 0 to 4 and y ranges from 0 to 2.
# Output:
# (0, 0)
# (0, 1)
# (0, 2)
# (1, 0)
# (1, 1)

# In a nested loop, both loops start together â€” but the inner loop finishes all its cycles first.
# Only then does the outer loop move to the next value, and the inner loop repeats.
