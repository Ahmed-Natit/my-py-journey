🐍 My Py Journey

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Py Journey. This repository is where I’ve collected everything I’ve learned while exploring Python—projects, exercises, scripts, and notes. It’s my personal space to experiment, challenge myself, and grow as a developer.

I’m Ahmed, a Python enthusiast. I created this repo to track my progress and practice new concepts. I enjoy solving problems with code, building practical projects, and constantly improving my skills. Over time, this collection has become a reflection of my learning process, showing how I approach challenges and apply Python to real problems.
This repository includes small projects, scripts I’ve written to automate tasks, exercises I’ve completed to strengthen my understanding, and notes I’ve taken along the way. Everything here is organized so that it’s easy to follow and understand, showing not just the final result but also the thought process behind it.

By exploring this repo, you can see my growth as a programmer, how I solve problems, and how I translate ideas into working code. It’s a place where curiosity meets practice, and where learning never stops.
I’m always excited to connect with people who share the same passion for coding and learning. You can reach out to me on GitHub, or via email at natitahmed@gmail.com.
Thanks for stopping by, and I hope my journey inspires you in some way.
